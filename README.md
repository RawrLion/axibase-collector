# Axibase Collector

## Overview

Axibase Collector is a Java-based ETL application that queries external data sources on schedule and uploads received data as series, properties, messages, and files into the Axibase Time Series Database.

It supports [collections](collections.md)-based automation in order to query as many data sources as possible with the same configuration.

## Typical Use Cases

* Download CSV/TSV file from a web or FTP server and upload it into ATSD.
* Query a web service, convert its JSON output into tabular format, and upload it into ATSD.
* Historize metrics by querying their current values and storing them in ATSD for analytics.
* Offload prunable data from relational databases for long-term storage in ATSD.
* Collect real-time performance metrics from Java applications (JMX), network devices (SNMP), etc.

## Supported Data/Network Protocols

* JDBC
* SNMP
* JMX
* ICMP
* TCP
* HTTP

## Supported File Formats

* CSV
* TSV
* Text
* JSON

## Supported Schemas

* [Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) (aka Socrata)

## Supported APIs

* Amazon Web Services CloudWatch
* Docker Engine
* HP OVPM (Performance Manager)
