# Axibase Collector

## Overview

Axibase Collector is a Java-based ETL application that queries external data sources on schedule and uploads received data as series, properties, messages, and files into the Axibase Time Series Database.

The Collector supports [collections](/docs/collections.md)-based automation to efficiently cope data from multiple sources with the same re-usable configuration.

## Typical Use Cases

* Download CSV/TSV file from a URL or an FTP server and upload it into ATSD.
* Query a web service, convert its JSON output into tabular format, and upload it into ATSD.
* Historize metrics by querying their current values and storing them in ATSD for analytics.
* Offload prunable data from relational databases for long-term storage in ATSD.
* Collect real-time performance metrics from Java applications (JMX), network devices (SNMP), etc.

## Supported Data/Network Protocols

* JDBC
* SNMP
* JMX
* ICMP
* TCP
* HTTP

## Supported File Formats

* CSV

## Supported Schemas

* [Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) (aka Socrata)

## Supported APIs
